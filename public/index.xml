      <description>Executive summary On behalf of the Canadian Conservative Party, we conduct this survey on selected Canadian residents who are eligible to vote on the 44th Canadian federal election. This survey has been done pre vote to understand in detail who are the supporters of Conservative. Statistical analysis has been carried out to interpret the survey result. We managed to reveal some interesting age and geographical patterns of our supporters by asking them some general personal questions in the survey.</description>
